## Interests

My primary interests are:

- ðŸŒŒ **Space Exploration**
- ðŸŒ† **Infrastructure/Modern Cities**
- ðŸ§¬ **Biotechnology**
- ðŸ’» **Computer Technology**
- ðŸ“š **Education**

## Preferred Operating Systems

Despite the intense hate and vitriol by some in the Linux Community, Windows has been around for a *long* time and has become increasingly reliable in numerous aspects. 

It's much harder to screw up setting up some major software, for example, on Windows, compared to on Linux, as software is usually installed via user-friendly graphical user interfaces on Windows, compared to a terminal/commandline on Linux. That being said, I still prefer Linux at times.

- **Windows**
   - Windows 11 (stable, aesthetically modern, has WSL2, best software support. It is my daily driver.)
   - Windows 7 (very nice and more lightweight OS, good software support, but outdated in many ways by modern standards. I don't use it but it was good.)

- **Linux Distributions**
  - Linux Mint (for desktop, due to user-friendliness and working out of box)
  - Ubuntu (for desktop, due to user-friendliness and working out of the box)
  - Debian (for servers or containers, as it's super stable and lightweight)
  - RHEL (for servers)


In *general*, I believe Windows is good for personal desktops (especially for the average person) and Linux is good for servers. This is common knowledge, but that's not why it's my belief.

## Programming Knowledge

Computer programming is not something I'm extremely attached to, I simply use it when necessary and don't use it when unnecessary. My preferred languages and technologies are as follows:

### General Software Development (primarily Linux-based)

- **Languages:** 
  - Python
  - C#
  - D
  - Bash Script
  - PowerShell

### Web Development

- **Technologies:**
  - HTML/CSS
  - WordPress
  - Docker (for containerizing WordPress)

## My Projects
- **Proprietary/Closed-Source**<br />
  - Solara <br />
    <sub>A program that manages containerized websites (specifically for Sol) using either Docker or Podman. Created using Z, Python, and Bash.</sub>

  - Z <br />
    <sub>A specialized programming language that is interpreted and compiled, created for Sol/Solara internal software, designed to be maximally-simple and easily understandable. Supports x86_64, AArch64, and AArch32 processor types. Syntax example: ``if OS=windows then batch("echo Hello Windows User") else if OS=linux then bash("echo Hello Linux User!")``. The Z interpreter is written in D.</sub>

  - Min Linux <br />
    <sub>Specialized software for Debian 12 to optimize it for, and add useful features for containerization via the Solara application.</sub>

- **Open Source**<br />
  - ssf (Super Simple Firewall) <br />
    <sub>Firewall program for Linux servers created as a wrapper of nftables, designed to be easy-to-use. **Development starts soon**</sub>

## Some more info

Most of my software is closed-source right now, so you won't find many public repositories on my GitHub.
