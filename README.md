## About Me
- **Name:** Jacob Zymet
- **Age:** 17
- **Location:** United States
- **Occupation:** Student and Founder of Sol [[website]](https://solcluster.com/) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/Sol-Global/)

## Interests
I'm passionate about:
- ðŸŒŒ Space Exploration
- ðŸŒ† City/World Infrastructure & Modern Cities
- ðŸ§¬ Biotechnology
- ðŸ’» Computer Technology
- ðŸ“š Education & Knowledge Sharing

## Preferred Operating Systems
I choose operating systems based on purpose and reliability:

- **High-Performance Workstations:**  
  - Windows 11, Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 41
- **Portability & Productivity:**  
  - Windows on ARM (Snapdragon X Elite) / macOS on MacBook Pro/Air (Apple Silicon)
- **Mission-Critical Servers:**  
  - Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  

I find Windows best for compatibility and usability, macOS ideal for portability, and Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL) perfect for server reliability, or development-centric workstations.

## Programming Knowledge
Programming supports my projects, rather than being a primary focus. I use:

- **Languages:** C#, Python/Cython, Nim, C, Rust
- **Web Development Tools:** HTML/CSS, WordPress, Docker

## Projects
- **Closed-Source Projects**  
   - **Solara:** A system to manage Solâ€™s containerized websites, using Docker and scripts in Python, Bash, and PowerShell.
   - **Min:** An internal programming language for Sol, designed for simplicity and readability. Written in C#, it supports amd64 and Arm architectures with syntax like `if OS=windows then batch("echo Hello Windows User") else if OS=linux then bash("echo Hello Linux User!")`.

- **Open Source Projects**  
   - **emx:** An experimental OS simulator written in C# that uses a minimal scripting language called EMXscript for learning and experimentation.

I primarily work on closed-source projects, so youâ€™ll find limited public repositories on my GitHub.
