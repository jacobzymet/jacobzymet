## Preferred Operating Systems

Despite the hate by the Linux Community, Windows has been around for a *long* time and has become increasingly reliable in numerous aspects. That being said, I still prefer Linux at times.

- **Windows**
   - Windows 11 (stable, aesthetically modern, has WSL2, best software support. It is my daily driver.)

- **Linux Distributions**
  - Ubuntu (due to user-friendliness and working out of the box)
  - Fedora (user friendly to a degree, mostly works out of the box)
  - Debian (for servers or containers, as it's super stable and lightweight)
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (for servers, as it's stable and comes with enterprise support)
