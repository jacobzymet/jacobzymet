## About Me

- **Occupation:** Student and Founder of Sol [[website]](https://solcluster.com/) [[github]](https://github.com/Sol-Global/)

## Interests

My primary interests are:

- ðŸŒŒ **Space Exploration**
- ðŸŒ† **Infrastructure/Modern Cities**
- ðŸ§¬ **Biotechnology**
- ðŸ’» **Computer Technology**
- ðŸ“š **Education**

## Preferred Operating Systems

Despite the intense hate and vitriol by some in the Linux Community, Windows has been around for a *long* time and has become increasingly reliable in numerous aspects. 

It's much harder to screw up setting up some major software, for example, on Windows, compared to on Linux, as software is usually installed via user-friendly graphical user interfaces on Windows, compared to a terminal/commandline on Linux. That being said, I still prefer Linux at times.

This is my view:

- **High-Performance Workstations**
   - Windows 11 (amd64)
   - Ubuntu 24.04 (amd64)
   - Fedora Workstation 40 (amd64)
 
- **Portability/Productivity On-The-Go, Ease of Use**
   - MacOS on MacBook Pro/Air (Apple Silicon/Arm64)

- **Servers with Critical Importance**
  - Ubuntu 24.04
  - Debian 12
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

In *general*, I believe Windows is ideal for high-performance workstations that need maximum compatibility and performance, MacOS (on Macbook) is ideal for portabaility and productivity on the go, and Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL 9) is ideal for mission-critical servers. This is common knowledge, but that's not why it's my belief.

## Programming Knowledge

Computer programming is not something I'm extremely attached to, I simply use it when necessary. My preferred languages and technologies are as follows:

### General Software Development (primarily Linux-based)

- **Languages:** 
  - Python
  - C#
  - Golang
  - C
  - Bash Script
  - PowerShell

### Web Development

- **Technologies:**
  - HTML/CSS
  - WordPress
  - Docker
  - Podman

## My Projects
- **Proprietary/Closed-Source**<br />
  - Solara <br />
    <sub>A program that manages Sol containerized websites using Docker. Written in Python, Bash, Powershell, and Min.</sub>

  - Min <br />
    <sub>A specialized programming language that is interpreted and compiled, created for Sol/Solara internal software, designed to be maximally-simple and easily understandable. Supports amd64, AArch64, and AArch32 processor types. Syntax example: ``if OS=windows then batch("echo Hello Windows User") else if OS=linux then bash("echo Hello Linux User!")``. The Min interpreter is written in C#.</sub>

- **Open Source**<br />
  - emx (Experimental Mock Operating System) <br />
    <sub>A C# program designed to simulate and replicate the functionality of a computer operating system, for experimentation/learning purposes. Uses its own minimal interpreted language called EMXscript.</sub>


## Some more info

Most of my software is closed-source right now, so you won't find many public repositories on my GitHub.
