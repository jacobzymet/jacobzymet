## About Me

- **Name:** Jacob Zymet
- **Age:** 17 years old
- **Location:** United States

## Interests

My primary interests are:

- ðŸŒŒ **Space Exploration**
- ðŸŒ† **Infrastructure/Modern Cities**
- ðŸ§¬ **Biotechnology**
- ðŸ’» **Computer Technology**
- ðŸ“š **Education**

## Preferred Operating Systems

Despite the hate by the Linux Community, Windows has been around for a *long* time and has become increasingly reliable in numerous aspects. 

It's much harder to screw up setting up some major software, for example, on Windows, compared to on Linux, as software is usually installed via user-friendly graphical user interfaces on Windows, compared to a terminal/commandline on Linux. That being said, I still prefer Linux at times.

- **Windows**
   - Windows 11 (stable, aesthetically modern, has WSL2, best software support. It is my daily driver.)
   - Windows 7 (very nice and more lightweight OS, good software support, but outdated in many ways by modern standards. I don't use it but it was good.)

- **Linux Distributions**
  - Ubuntu (for desktop, due to user-friendliness and working out of the box)
  - Debian (for servers or containers, as it's super stable and lightweight)
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (for servers, as it's stable and includes enterprise support)
  - AlmaLinux/RockyLinux (for servers, essentially 1:1 with RHEL but 100% free and no enterprise support)

## Programming Knowledge

Computer programming is not something I'm extremely attached to, I simply use it when necessary and don't use it when unnecessary. My preferred languages and technologies are as follows:

### General Software Development (primarily Linux-based)

- **Languages:** 
  - Python
  - Visual Basic
  - Bash
  - Go

### Web Development

- **Technologies:**
  - HTML/CSS
  - WordPress
  - Docker (for containerizing WordPress)

## My Projects
- **Proprietary/Closed-Source**
  - Solara
    <sub>A program that manages containerized websites (specifically for Sol) using either Docker or Podman. Created using Python and Bash.</sub>

## Some more info

Most of my software is closed-source right now, so you won't find many public repositories on my GitHub.
